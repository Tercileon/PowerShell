## Deleting Files and Folders

**Remove-Item** cmdlet is used to delete a directory by passing the path of the directory to be deleted.

In this example, we'll delete a folder D:\Temp\Test Folder1

**Type** the following command in PowerShell ISE Console

```powershell
Remove-Item 'D:\temp\Test Folder1'
```

You can see the Test Folder1 in Windows Explorer is deleted now.

In this example, we'll remove the folder D:\Temp\Test Folder1 recursively. In first example, PowerShell confirms if directory is not empty. In this case, it will simply delete the item.

**Type** the following command in PowerShell ISE Console

```powershell
Remove-Item 'D:\temp\Test Folder' -Recurse
