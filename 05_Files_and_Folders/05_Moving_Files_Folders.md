## Moving Files and Folders

**Move-Item** cmdlet is used to move a directory by passing the path of the directory to be moved and destination path where the folder is to be moved.

In this example, we'll move a folder D:\Temp\Test to D:\Temp\Test1

**Type** the following command in PowerShell ISE Console

```powershell

Move-Item D:\temp\Test D:\temp\Test1

```
You can see the Test directory moved to Test1 directory in Windows Explorer.

In this example, Create a file test.txt in Test folder in D:\Temp\ and then run the same command.

**Type** the following command in PowerShell ISE Console

```powershell

Move-Item D:\temp\Test D:\temp\Test1

```

The content of Test1 directory is in Windows Explorer where it contains both the Test directory and test file.

Move-Item cmdlet is used to move a file by passing the path of the file to be moved and destination path where the file is to be moved.

The Test.txt is now in the Test1 directory. Test.txt has been moved from Test to Test1.
