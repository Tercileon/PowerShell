## Commands - Performance Lab

Using what you learned as well as additional resources you can find on the internet or using **the help system** ( hint, hint), complete the following tasks in Windows PowerShell:


1.  Display a list of running processes.

2.  Display the 100 most recent entries from the Application event log. (Don’t use Get-WinEvent for this. We’ve shown you another command that will do this task.) This is for Windows operating systems only.

3.  Display a list of all commands that are of the cmdlet type. (This is tricky—we’ve shown you Get-Command, but you’re going to have to read the help to find out how to narrow down the list as we’ve asked.)

4.  Display a list of all aliases.

5.  Make a new alias, so you can run np to launch Notepad from a PowerShell prompt. This is for Windows only unless you’ve installed wine on Linux.

6.  Display a list of services that begin with the letter M. Again, read the help for the necessary command—and don’t forget that the asterisk (*) is a near-universal wildcard in PowerShell. Note that this will work only on Windows operating -systems.

7.  Display a list of all Windows Firewall rules. You’ll need to use Help or Get-Command to discover the necessary cmdlet. Again, this will work only on Windows operating systems.

8.  Display a list only of inbound Windows Firewall rules. You can use the same cmdlet as in the previous task, but you’ll need to read its help to discover the necessary parameter and its allowable values. Once more, Windows operating systems only for this one.

We hope these tasks seem straightforward to you. If so—excellent. You’re taking advantage of your existing command-line skills to make PowerShell perform a few practical tasks for you. If you’re new to the command-line world, these tasks are a good introduction to what you’ll be doing in the rest of this powershell course.
