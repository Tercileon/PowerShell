**Powershell_Training**

Windows PowerShell is the command and scripting language from Microsoft built into all versions of Windows since Windows Server 2008. Although PowerShell is new and different (or has new features you haven’t yet explored), it’s been designed to make use of what you already know, making it easy to learn. It’s also designed to allow you to learn a bit at a time.
